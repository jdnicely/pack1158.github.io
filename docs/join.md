# Join Cub Scouts

We will be holding a Join Scouting Night recruitment event this fall, typically
around the third Wednesday of September, in the Ashburn Elementary school
cafeteria. Continue to check back here for up-to-date information.

Please note that Pack 1158 has made the decision to remain an all boy pack for
the upcoming scout year. If you are specifically looking for a co-ed pack
participating in the Family Scouting program, we would be happy to refer you to
any of the wonderful area packs who are offering co-ed programs.

In the meantime, take a look at the following Pack 1158 resources.

- [Handbook](resources/handbook.md)
- [Calendar](resources/calendar.md)

You can fill out an [inquiry form](https://my.bsa.us/082paa1158mb) and we will
be sure to reach back out to you about membership in Pack 1158.
