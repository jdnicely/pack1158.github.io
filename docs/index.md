## National Summertime Pack Award Events

All events listed below count toward the [National Summertime Pack
Award](https://www.scouting.org/awards/awards-central/national-summertime/).
This is an individual recognition, and scouts participating in three eligible
events (one per month) are eligible to wear the National Summertime Pack Award
pin on the right pocket flap of their uniform.  Parents and den leaders should
work together to make sure attendance is noted in Scoutbook. _Note that
additional events can be arranged, anything from a picnic to a hike or a
pick-up kickball game. If you have an idea, just let us know!_
