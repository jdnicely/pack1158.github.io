# Pack 1158 Handbook

## Welcome to Cub Scouting

As a parent, you want your son to grow up to be a person of worth; a self-reliant, dependable, and caring individual. Scouting has these same goals in mind for him. Since 1910, we have been weaving lifetime values into fun and educational activities designed to assist parents in strengthening character, developing good citizenship, and enhancing phys-ical fitness in youth.

These values help your son make good decisions throughout his lifetime and give him confidence as he becomes an adult leader of tomorrow. With all the negative influences in today’s society, Scouting provides your son with a positive peer group and a program that is fun and adventurous and helps him to “be prepared” to shape his own future.

### Scout Basics

Your Boy is a Member of a *Den* (he will be assigned an existing den or a new den will be formed).
- A den has usually up to 8 boys
- The den meets 2-3 times a month
- The den is led by a den leader and an assistant (parents or adults connected to boys in the Pack).
- The den may also be assisted by a den chief (an older Boy Scout).

Your Boy (and his Den) is a Member of a *Pack* (we are Pack 1158).
- A pack is made up of all the dens.
- The pack meets once a month (the 3rd Wednesday of each month at 7pm at Ashburn Elementary School). All Cub Scout families attend.
- Pack meetings have games, skits, songs, ceremonies, and presentations of badges that the boys earned that month.

The Pack is Run by the *Pack Committee* 
- The pack committee is made up of a group of adults that administer the program of the pack. Usually committee members, as well as other pack leaders, are parents or family of boys in the pack.
- The committee meets once month (1st Wednesday of each month at 7pm at AES).
- The committee is led by a Committee Chairperson.
- The committee selects leaders, performs record keeping, manages pack finances, orders badges, maintains pack equipment, helps train leaders, and recognizes leaders.

The Pack is Owned by the *Chartered Organization* (our Organization is the Dulles International Airport Rotary Club).
- Chartered organizations include schools, parent-school associations, religious organizations, ser-vice clubs, and other groups interested in youth.
