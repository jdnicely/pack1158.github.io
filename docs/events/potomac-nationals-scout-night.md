## Description

It's a great time for BASEBALL!

Pack 1158 is heading to the ball field this summer!  Join us at Pfitzner
Stadium, home of the Potomac Nationals, for Scouting Night 2019 on Saturday,
July 20th.

With admission, all scouts and families will enjoy the following:

- A ticket to the game 
- An exclusive P-Nats hat 
- A pre-game parade for all Scouts 
- Post-game Kids Run the Bases
- Fireworks after the game
- A movie on the big screen after the game
- A commemorative Scout Patch (handed out the next morning)
- Camping in the outfield under the stars!

 Game time is 6:35 pm, gates open at 5pm.

**The Pack will not be able to cover any of these costs but we will still
consider this a Pack event for the month of July.**

If interested in attending this event, please respond and we will try to put
together a group for purchasing tickets.  We need to have a group of 20 or more
to receive a group rate discount on tickets.  More information will be sent
after we see how many are interested. For all info on this event, visit this
