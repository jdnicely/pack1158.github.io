## Description

As we ramp up for a fabulous new school year, let's all get
together for our annual Pack Bike Hike! We will plan to ride our
bikes together on the W&OD trail. Here are the details:

## Notes:

- We will make a 14-mile round trip to Leesburg and back. 
- Younger scouts who would like a shorter bike hike can ride to Trailside Park (5-miles round trip) or Luck Stone Quarry (7-miles round trip).
- This is NOT a drop-off event. A parent/guardian must accompany Scouts.
- Helmets are ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED, for EVERY person who will be riding. Those without a helmet will not be allowed to ride (parents included).
- Please wear your Class B shirt. 
- There is no cost for this event.
- To Pack: Water, First Aid kit, helmet, and your trusty bike.
