From the Ashburn Village
[website](https://www.ashburnvillage.org/calendar2.php?is=1&cat=&view=event&id=405):

> 10:30 am - Come join our parade!
>
> Dress up your bike, wagon, stroller, and yourself. The parade will start at 
Fincastle Field, go down Fincastle to Ringold, onto the lake path, ending at
the Pavilion. The route is 1 mile longâ€”those wishing for a shorter walk may
start elsewhere along the route.

We will meet in our Class A uniforms at Fincastle Field and take part in the
parade, carrying our Pack banner. Details to come.
