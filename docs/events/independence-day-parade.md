Fincastle Field, go down Fincastle to Ringold, onto the lake path, ending at
the Pavilion. The route is 1 mile longâ€”those wishing for a shorter walk may
start elsewhere along the route.

> The Party will have a DJ, Dunk Tank, Giant Water Slide, Train, and a Moon
Bounce.  To cool off, the pool and paddle boats will be open.

We will meet in our Class A uniforms at 10:15 am in the Fincastle Field staging
area. We will carry the Pack 1158 banner and lead the parade. The Ashburn
Village HOA has told me that scouts participating in the parade (even if living
outside the village), will also receive FREE wristbands for the party.
